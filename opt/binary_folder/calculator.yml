calculator_id: lambda_force
provides:
- lambda_4p  # reorganization energy and HR factor of singlet excited state via 4-point and displacement approach
- lambda_force  # reorganization energy and HR factor of  singlet excited state via force approach
- BOD  # bond-order difference between HF configuration and HOMO->LUMO excitation configuration
- NAC  # Nonadiabatic coupling between S0 and singlet excited state
#- SOC  # spin-orbit coupling between S0 and triplet state (only ORCA now)
